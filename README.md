# Project Auth API

The assignment was to build an API with authenticated users and encrypted passwords.
Then connect the API to frontend with login, signup and an authenticated endpoint.

## The problem

We started with creating the backend endpoints and authentication of user. We learned about encryption of passwords and use of accesstokens. We used Mongo DB to create the backend API and used React and Redux to create the frontend. 

Our ambition was to have a more detailed and advanced authenticated endpoint with a Batman movie dataset but we didn't have time to make it work. If we had more time we wanted to keep debugging it to make it work.
